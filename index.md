### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1 was a favorite because I had very little experience using linux and I feel that being able to use basic linux commands is important in the computer science field. This lab allowed me to get a lot more practice and now I feel comfortable navigating through a terminal, as well as comfortable using basic linux commands.

* Lab 3
    Lab 3 was my favorite lab because it was the first lab that we did that showed me coding could be used to solve real life problems. Part-1 allowed us to calculate the unit price of a pizza and while maybe most people would not need to know the price per square inch of a pizza this showed me that coding could help me easily solve everyday problems. Similary, part-2 allowed me to find the answer to a long math problem without having to do it by hand.

* Lab 4
    Lab 4 was a favorite because it allowed me to practice calling frunctions from one file to another. I was also able to use arithmetic operators in this lab which I had not been able to use much previously. Lastly, in part-2 I was able to use if-else statements to make a game which allowed me to use coding for something fun.
